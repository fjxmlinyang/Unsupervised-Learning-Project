# Unsupervised-Learning-Project

In this project, we use unsupervised learning models to cluster unlabeled documents into different groups, visualize the results and identify their latent topics/structures.

We analyze the customer's review and extract the main topic of an E-Commerce customer review dataset by Natural Language Process.

  - We start from reprocessing the customer reviews by Tokenizing and Stemming
  - We extract the feature and build the TF-IDF matrix
  - We train unsupervised learning model by K-Means and Latent Dirichlet Allocation Algorithm
  - From LDA Algorithm, we can see from the customer review: topics are about good, nice,beauti, etc. From K-means methods, the topic includes love, nice, good, but it is not cheap.
