# Unsupervised-Learning-Project

In this project, we use unsupervised learning models to cluster unlabeled documents into different groups, visualize the results and identify their latent topics/structures.

We anaylsis the customer's review and extract the main topic of an E-Commerce customer review dataset by Natural Language Process.

There are some sections:
  - Preprocess the customer reviews by Tokenizing and Stemming
  - Extract the feature and build the TF-IDF matrix
  - Train unsupervised learning model by K-Means and Latent Dirichlet Allocation Algorithm
  - Result Evaluation: From LDA, we can see from the customer review: topics are about god, nice ,beauti, etc. From K-means, we can see also love, nice, good, but it is not cheap.
